## Design and Approaches
	Our team had designed this application based of the Agile Methodology. We held weekly meeting discussing the different features we wish to implement by the end of next week. To keep track of ideas, we heavily rely on Trello.
	At the end of the week, our team used IdeaBoards to re-evaluate how our sprint went. For example, the sprint's good aspects, the bad aspects, and how we can change the bad into good.
	Our application went through two versions and as of now, we have the V3 hosted on Heroku.

## Version History
	V1 contained had one upload method, 3 filters, and very blocky UI.
	V2 contained 10 filters with multiple upload methods. Filters were also re-designed to be more efficient. Social media integration was also a small part of this version
	V3 (final) mainly focused on the UI. Filters and upload methods remained the same but added more user functionality. It looks a lot cleaner and much more professional with proper navigation bars and user experience.
