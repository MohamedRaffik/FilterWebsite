### Design and Approaches
	Our team had designed this application based of the Agile Methodology. We held weekly meeting discussing the
	different features we wish to implement by the end of next week. To keep track of ideas, we heavily rely on
	Trello. At the end of the week, our team used IdeaBoards to re-evaluate how our sprint went. For example,
	the sprint's good aspects, the bad aspects, and how we can change the bad into good. Our application went
	through
	two versions and as of now, we have the V3 hosted on Heroku.
